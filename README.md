Take control of your desktop from anywhere
How to install VNC Viewer?
Once you‚Äôve downloaded and installed the VNC server app on the host system, the process of taking control is fairly simple and straightforward. In order to download the server app, you need to go through some basic instructions in an Explorer-style wizard. The installation package is lightweight, and doesn‚Äôt affect system resources. In case you‚Äôre connecting devices over the internet, you might have to configure the network.

For remote deployment, VNC Viewer gives optional MSIs under the ‚ÄòWindows‚Äô tab.

Since the app is completely free to use, you don‚Äôt have to pay a subscription or fee. All you need to do is accept the EULA when you run the program for the first time.

How does VNC Viewer work?
VNC, short for Virtual Network Computing, is a remote desktop sharing system, allowing you to take control of a system in a remote location. The software uses the reliable remote-frame buffer protocol to establish a secure connection. It transmits the mouse and keyboard events from one machine to another and uses a network to relay graphical-screen updates in the reverse direction. Since VNC download is platform-independent, the program gives access to servers and clients for multiple GUI-based operating systems.

It‚Äôs important to note that multiple clients can connect to a single VNC server simultaneously. However, the primary uses of the technology include accessing files on a remote computer and technical support. Apart from allowing you to control the PC‚Äôs screen, the remote PC application supports Bluetooth functionality for mice and keyboards.

In addition to this, it backs up and synchronises data between all the devices. You only need to sign in to the VNC Viewer on each device. The program password-protects every remote computer right out of the box. In order to log in to the computer, you can use the same password and username as the host device. All the sessions support end-to-end encryption and give complete protection to your data from hackers and cyber threats.

For every system that you want to control with the remote desktop software, head to the RealVNC website and download the VNC Connect program on each device. The next step is to sign in to VNC Viewer on the local machine using your RealVNC credentials. From here, you‚Äôll be able to select the remote machine and establish a secure connection. Overall, the process is simple, straightforward, and doesn‚Äôt require you to possess any technical skills or knowledge.

Secure, fast, and easy-to-use on Windows PCs
VNC Viewer is an efficient remote desktop app, which allows you to access a work PC with your home system, or vice versa. The hassle-free application is easy to use and comes with robust features to ensure security. VNC Viewer uses encrypted connections, giving you much-needed peace of mind about your data.
